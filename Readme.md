# How to disable a particular row in the GridView

## Starting with version 19.2 we supported this functionality out of the box via the  [Disabled Cell Behavior](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/401146/common-features/behaviors/disabled-cell-behavior?v=19.2)
<p>This example demonstrates how to enable/disable rows using the new behavior. A disabled row is a row that has specific appearance, and its in-place editors can't be activated.
